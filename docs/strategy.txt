        Weekly-Daily-Hourly timeframe candles are scored on bullish-ness/bearish-ness and entered as environment variables when analyzing shorter timeframes
        
        Minor support and resistance are defined based on trendlines calculated using candle highs and lows. Trendlines include a measure of average change over time (mu(t)) and volatility of change over time (sigma_mu(t))

        Major support and resistance are based on exponential moving averages calculated using Fibonnacci numbers (particularly, the 8, 21, and 55 EMAs)

        Entry and exit points are highlighted on the 5 and 1 minute timeframes
