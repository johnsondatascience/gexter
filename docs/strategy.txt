        Weekly-Daily-Hourly timeframe candles are scored on bullish-ness/bearish-ness and entered as environment variables when analyzing shorter timeframes
        Minor support and resistance are based on trendlines calculated using candle highs and lows, including a measure of average change over time (mu(t)) and volatility of change over time (sigma_mu(t))
        Major support and resistance are based on exponential moving averages using Fibonnacci numbers (particularly, the 8, 21, and 55 EMAs)
        Entry and exit points are highlighted on the 5 and 1 minute timeframes
    Dealer/Market-Maker positioning
        Next-day and intra-day dealer positioning in the major indexes is measured by Gamma exposure by strike per expiration date.
        Particular attention should be paid to near-term expiries, especially 0DTE contracts.
        Trading signals are derived based on net GEX per strike in addition to intraday changes to GEX as measured by the "greeks_update_at" timestamp
